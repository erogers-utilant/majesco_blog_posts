# The Transformer Architecture and the Future of AI in Insurance

Artificial intelligence has arrived in the world of insurance technology in two ways, gradually at first, and now suddenly. Features that made smarter decisions and enabled better forecasts used to be narrow in scope and limited in application. But recent breakthroughs open the door to advancements that span insurance carriers' entire business processes. 

But what are the key steps required to keep up with the rapid advancements brought about by machine learning? Before we can answer that, let's focus on the underlying architecture that is driving many of the most exciting changes we've seen -- the Transformer.

## The Transformer: Bringing About a New Era for AI

The Transformer is a new deep-learning architecture for AI models that underlies the most exciting advancements of modern machine learning. OpenAI's recent implementation, ChatGPT, is merely the most recent of the exciting products that have a Transformer architecture under the hood.

### The Challenge of Harnessing Machine Learning Before Transformers

It's worthwhile to consider how the Transformer addresses multiple challenges in machine learning at once. 

**No More Bespoke Architectures**

> Before the invention of the Transformer architecture, each AI problem required a bespoke architecture. State-of-the-art computer vision models required translational invariance in the form of Convolutional Networks. Natural Language Understanding needed stateful architectures, such as LSTMs. 
> 
> Originally built for natural language processing, the Transformer has demonstrated great versatility and has taken on tasks in various domains of AI, including computer vision (ViT), speech recognition (Whisper), and text generation (GPT). The architecture can handle any data that can be broken up into tokens, segments, or patches, making it incredibly powerful.

**Scalable Models Without a Size Limit**

> Model selection used to bring a Goldilocks problem for model size. Models that were too large were slow to train, while smaller models had limited capabilities. Additionally, there was a challenge of harnessing increasing volumes of data. Skimping on data would lead to models that overfit, while training on large data sets was expensive.
> 
> The architecture of the Transformer is extensible, like Lego-bricks, making it easy to expand or shrink the model to meet the needs of the problem. What's more, the Transformer is incredibly fast to train given its size. By focusing on faster, more easily parallelizable operations, the computational limits that constrained previous architectures no longer apply. 
> 
> As of the time of this writing, despite four years of research, no upper-bound has yet been found in the architecture's ability to soak up data and improve its own performance. Although the training process can be expensive, its versatility makes it closer to a "Train Once and Use Everywhere" model than any model architecture we have ever seen before.

## How Insurance Carriers Should Approach Transformer Adoption

**Start with the lowest hanging fruit**

> Does your business produce free text containing actionable business insights? Are policyholders, agents, or third-parties sending documents, imagery, or other rich, unstructured data formats into your system? If so, your data and analytics team must capitalize on Transformer technology to unlock the business value within. 
> 
> Majesco is currently helping users of its P&C Claims platform make the most of FNOL, loss descriptions, and every text note created during its claims process. Fine-tuned Transformer models back our recently released **Subrogation Intelligence** product to ensure that claims eligible for subrogation recoveries never fall through the cracks.

**Identify how Transformers can reduce costs and increase profitability**

> Carriers should identify which business processes are cost centers and focus on deploying machine learning to streamline and automate as much as possible. Those that delay in adoption of this technology risk falling behind their competition and, ultimately, hurting their loss ratio.
> 
> At Majesco, our P&C Policy Administration application can put machine learning into the hands of underwriters to help them generate more accurate quotes, understand market trends, and spot missing opportunities for endorsements or exclusions to promote profitability.

**Recognize and mitigate risks in the usage of AI**

> As with any new technology, it's important to understand the limitations and risks associated with the application of artificial intelligence. Users of ChatGPT will be familiar with its occasional overconfidence or irrational output. Understanding how to implement machine learning systems with an eye toward privacy and ethical application is crucial for long-term success.

The Transformer architecture has revolutionized AI, and now the insurance industry has an opportunity to harness its tremendous capabilities. Carriers that invest now are going to be well-positioned to keep ahead of their competition. Every component of the policy lifecycle should be examined for automation opportunities. As Churchill put it, "No idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered with a searching but at the same time a steady eye."
